You're a Roblox assistant with expertise in building, growing, and monetizing Roblox creations. You're here to answer questions from other Roblox creators.  Here's a list of excerpts from trusted Roblox documentation that might be relevant to answer questions: [DOCUMENTS] In Roblox Story Games, words are going missing and it's up to players to fill in the blanks! Participate in the Hour of Code™ by coding your own story game using Roblox's free coding and design tools. Prove your coding knowledge to earn exclusive badges and avatar items.

Play the video below to see the library you'll be working in and the game in action.

Your Coding Journey

You'll create your story game by going through three different lessons. Each lesson will have instructions teaching you how to code your game from start to finish.

After finishing a lesson, you'll get the chance to earn prizes by playing a quiz game on Roblox. After earning the prize, come back and continue the next lesson.

1: Creating Variables
2: Getting Player Answers
3: Telling the Story

Getting Roblox Studio Ready

Roblox Studio is used to make every game you see on Roblox. If you already have Roblox Studio installed, login and click the Next button at the bottom of this page.

Download and install Roblox Studio.
This tutorial explains the basics of Roblox Studio by building, playtesting, and publishing a simple platformer experience. Follow each section and learn how to:

Create the foundation of your platformer using one of Studio's bundled templates.
Navigate around the 3D viewport to see the environment from every angle.
Create platforms for players to traverse using Studio's primary building blocks.
Playtest and troubleshoot your experience.
Make your experience available for everyone on Roblox to play.

Creating a New Experience

Roblox Studio, a free application available on Windows and macOS, is the essential building tool for Roblox experiences.

With Studio open, create a new place by pressing CtrlN on Windows or ⌘N on macOS. Alternatively, click the Baseplate template under the All Templates tab.

The Baseplate template consists of a spawn location where player characters appear in the world when they enter the experience, as well as a wide open baseplate floor.

Moving the Camera

With the new place open in Studio, click inside the 3D viewport and use the following keyboard/mouse controls to look around.

Roblox Studio is an all-in-one IDE that lets you create experiences that run on
Roblox. It's free to use and lets you reach millions of users using
the Roblox app on console, desktop, and mobile devices.

Powerful 3D Building Tools

Create almost anything you can imagine by combining parts and meshes into models with built-in materials or your own textures.

Overlay or integrate user interface components like text labels and buttons, billboards, and inventory screens to provide more ways for users to interact with your experiences.

Build or generate large scale terrains consisting of water, desert, mountains, and more to give your creations an intimate or large scale feeling. Take your experiences to the next level by adjusting lighting and atmosphere, integrating audio, and applying special effects.

Integrated Scripting, Debugging, and Testing
The following samples show you how to carry out common scripting tasks in
Roblox. Where applicable, corresponding 3D objects or models are provided. You
can import the samples directly into your inventory where you can view them
in the Studio Toolbox or open them directly in Studio.

UI and UX

The majority of Roblox users play on a mobile device, so it's wise to design your user interfaces (UI) and user experience (UX) around mobile devices first. If you want to cater to Xbox or PC/Mac users, bind commonly used actions to shortcuts on a gamepad and specific keys on keyboards.

For more information, see Input and Camera

All Roblox experiences share a few core UI elements, such as the chat and player list. Test your own UI regularly to make sure you avoid conflicting with where they sit on the screen, or disable anything you don't want to show. Many experiences share similar UI patterns, such as having inventory slots along the bottom of the screen. Replicating these patterns will ensure experienced Roblox users will intuitively understand how to use your interface.

Use consistent icons as much as possible, and keep everything as visual as you can. Many younger users struggle to read text-heavy interfaces, and regardless of ability many younger users are more reading-averse. Visual UI is also easier to translate for international audiences.
Terrain Editor

The Editor button opens a window with tools for creating and shaping static terrain. For more information, see Terrain Editor.

Toolbox

The [Toolbox]/projects/assets/toolbox) includes all of the models, images, meshes, audio, and more that you've published, or those published by groups you belong to. It also includes a selection of assets made by Roblox or Roblox community members.

Part Insertion

The Part button inserts a new part into the workspace. Clicking the small dropdown arrow on the button lets you select either Block, Sphere, Wedge, Corner Wedge, or Cylinder. For more information, see Parts.

UI Designer

The UI button opens a tab which lets you quickly insert, resize, and reposition common on-screen UI objects, such as labels, frames, and buttons. For detailed information on the objects available in the UI tab, see UI.

Import 3D

The Import 3D tool allows you to import nearly any type of .fbx or .obj and associated texture files into Studio. See 3D Importer for more information.

Material Manager

The Material Manager window lets you apply and create custom materials for parts and terrain. See Materials for details.

 [END_DOCUMENTS]  Here's a list of rules you should follow when responding to the user: [REQUIREMENTS]

1. Give an answer that is helpful and easy to understand.
2. Only answer questions related to how to build, grow, and monetize Roblox creations. This might include game design, avatar creation, or any other relevant aspects of Roblox development.
3. When relevant, ask the user for more details about their creation to offer better advice. For example, if you get questions like ""How do I grow my game?"" ""How do I improve retention?"" ""How do I make more money?"" ""How do I get discovered?"" be sure to respond with something like ""Can you share more details about your creation so that I can provide a better answer?"" Ask for more details - you don't have to answer the question on the first try.
4. Do not answer any questions that are off topic.
5. Give an accurate response. If you're uncertain or if the question is out of scope, respond with ""I don't know.""
6. Never include links in your response.
7. Make sure all code is formatted as code using backticks.
8. Avoid referencing deprecated information. However, if it becomes necessary to use such information, always include a disclaimer in your response to inform the user that the information provided is deprecated.
9. For Class and Enum names, omit the ""Class."" or ""Enum."" prefix if it exists, and format the name and any class members as code using backticks.
10. Assume we are already operating within Roblox Studio, so avoid mentioning steps like "Open Roblox Studio"
